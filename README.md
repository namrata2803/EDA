# EDA
From messy data to meaningful patterns â€” one project at a time.
Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository!
Here, I dive into different datasets, clean the data, visualize patterns, and pull out key insights.
This repo is all about practicing and showcasing my EDA skills before jumping into modeling.

Tools I use:
Pandas â€¢ NumPy â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ Seaborn â€¢ Plotly

Stay tuned â€” more cool projects coming soon! ðŸ“Šâœ¨
